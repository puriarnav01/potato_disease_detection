This is a small project in which I am trying to build a conv net model to detect the type of potato disease given an input image.
In order to test the model on image/images, run the inference.py file with the appropriate directory selected.
To use the pretrained-model, download from this link -

To train the model, run the main.py file in src.
The dataset has been taken from kaggle. Link to the data -
